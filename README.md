In here I'm hosting experiments I'll be doing while learning eBPF for my thesis (see https://github.com/artogahr/lockne)

Main resources are:
* For the theory: https://cilium.isovalent.com/hubfs/Learning-eBPF%20-%20Full%20book.pdf
* For being able to do it in Rust: https://aya-rs.dev/book/
* As a reference: https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/reference-guides/bpf/index.html#
